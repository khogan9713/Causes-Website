			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<h3>The Girls Who Code Clubs Program teaches computer science to 6th-12th grade girls. This unique and scalable model enables girls nationally to access Girls Who Code in their communities. Clubs have launched nationally in over 25 States, helping thousands of girls learn how to code.</h3>
			<h4>The Girls Who Code Clubs Program Experience:</h4>
			<p>Skills — Forty hours of instruction in computer science including project based activities to reinforce concepts like conditionals, lists, and loops as well as skills like mobile app development.</p>
			<p>Exposure — Girls Who Code Clubs host speakers, coordinate field trips and engage with the local tech community. Girls Who Code facilitates exclusive connections where possible, providing unique opportunities to Club participants.</p>
			<p>Community — As Clubs participants, girls have access to this supportive and engaged network of teachers, mentors, professionals, and fellow students.</p>

			<h3>Volunteer to Teach</h3>
			<p>Our volunteer instructors are at the core of the Girls Who Code Clubs Program. This is a truly unique opportunity to empower women in CS and help transform the landscape of tech into a better, more inclusive industry.</p>
			<p>Our Instructors are industry professionals, undergraduate and graduate students, and computer science enthusiasts who are committed to achieving gender parity in the tech workforce. Instructors must have experience in Computer Science to qualify. We take care of the rest with a comprehensive curriculum and training in CS education and classroom management techniques.

			<p>“We need to encourage [the girls] to be a part of this world. There’s so many things people can do instead of watching these statistics keep going more and more dismal every day and wondering why it’s not changing.”— GWC Club Volunteer</p>
			<h3>Starting a Club</h3>
			<p>We partner with schools, universities, libraries, and community centers to bring Girls Who Code Clubs to girls across the country. All faculty members or employees can apply to start a Club in their communities.</p>
			<p>More information about starting a Club can be found here. Apply here to start a Club in your community.</p>
			<p>“This is a real tangible pathway to careers in computer science and to the real world.”— Club Faculty Advisor</p>
			<p>“What’s exciting about Girls Who Code is the overwhelming response we’ve had. The girls asked for this and we even have a waiting list. It was the perfect fit for our school.” — Club Faculty Advisor</p>
