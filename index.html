		<h2>Mission & Vision</h2>

		<h3>Girls Who Code programs work to inspire, educate, and equip girls with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities.</h3>

		<h4>Inspire</h4>
			<p>In 1984, 37% of all computer science graduates were women, but today that number is just 18%. 20% of AP Computer Science test-takers are female, and 0.4% of high school girls express interest in majoring in Computer Science. What’s going on?</p>
			<p>Girls Who Code believes to close the gender gap in technology, we have to inspire girls to pursue computer science by exposing them to real life and on screen role models. We engage engineers, developers, executives, and entrepreneurs to teach and motivate the next generation. Our guest speakers, mentors, and instructors are leaders in their fields, working in positions our girls aspire to attain.</p>
		<h4>Educate</h4>
			<p>Our unique pairing of high quality instruction in programming fundamentals, web development and design, mobile development, and robotics with exposure to real-world technology companies is unmatched by any other program.</p>
			<p>Girls Who Code programs are providing unparalleled computer science education to girls nationwide — giving them the hard and soft skills needed to become the technologists of tomorrow. We don’t just offer exposure to technology, we train tomorrow’s engineers.</p>
		<h4>Vision</h4>
			<p>Our vision is to reach gender parity in computing fields. We believe this is paramount to ensure the economic prosperity of women, families, and communities across the globe, and to equip citizens with the 21st century tools for innovation and social change. We believe that more girls exposed to computer science at a young age will lead to more women working in the technology and engineering fields.</p>
		<h4>Path to Succes</h4>
			<p>The U.S. Department of Labor projects that by 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer specialist job openings. To reach gender parity by 2020, women must fill half of these positions, or 700,000 computing jobs. Anecdotal data tells us that an average of 30% of those students with exposure to computer science will continue in the field. This means that 4.6M adolescent girls will require some form of exposure to computer science education to realize gender parity in 2020. Girls Who Code has set out to reach 25% of those young women needed to realize gender parity.</p>

		<h3>Girls Who Code aims to provide computer science education and exposure to 1 million young women by 2020.</h3>

			<p>Together with leading educators, engineers, and entrepreneurs, Girls Who Code has developed a new model for computer science education, pairing intensive instruction in robotics, web design, and mobile development with high-touch mentorship and exposure led by the industry’s top female engineers and entrepreneurs. Since beginning in 2012, Girls Who Code to date has served over 3,860 girls in 29 states.</p>

				<h2> Why it matters</h2>
				<h3>In middle school, 74% of girls express interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), but when choosing a college major, just 0.4% of high school girls select computer science.</h3>
